	<h1>JavaScript Objects</h1>
	<p>Te recuerdas que...variables are containers for data values. Well, objects are also variables. But objects can contain many values.</p>
	<p><strong>JavaScript objects are containers for named values.</strong></p>
	<p>Example: </p>
	<div id="objectex"></div>

	<script>
		
		// Create variable called car which is an object that containes many values. Values assigned to car variable.

		var car = {type: "Fiat", model: "500", color: "white"}; 

		var statement = "Ok so for some reason, when you print the variable car, you get this... " + car + "." + " Just look in your console for a closer look!"

		document.getElementById("objectex").innerHTML = statement;
